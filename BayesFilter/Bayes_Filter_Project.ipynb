        "When the robot always takes the action ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù and always receives the measurement ‚Äúdoor open,‚Äù the Bayes Filter started with a prior belief of 50% that the door is open. With each iteration, the sensor reports that the door is open, gradually increasing this belief. Since the action is \"do nothing,\" the belief change is solely based on the sensor's measurement. It took 9 iterations for the belief to surpass 99.99% certainty. This progression demonstrates the sensor's influence on updating the belief state, with the true positive rate (60% chance of correctly detecting an open door) playing a key role in how quickly the belief converges to near certainty.\n",

        "\n",
        "For this scenario, where the robot always takes the action \"push\" and always receives the measurement \"door open,\" the filter's behavior was notably different. Due to the design of the filter, where a \"push\" action is assumed to open the door with certainty, the belief was immediately set to 100% certainty after the first action. This resulted in achieving the 99.99% certainty threshold in just 1 iteration. The outcome here highlights the impact of the action on the belief state ‚Äì the \"push\" action is considered definitive, overriding the prior belief and any sensor input to set the belief at full certainty."

        "The code defines and utilizes a Bayesian Filter to estimate the state of a door‚Äîopen or closed‚Äîbased on sensor measurements and actions taken to alter the state (i.e., pushing the door). The BayesFilter class maintains a belief about the door's state, which it updates in two steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Prediction Step: The filter anticipates the outcome of an action without yet considering new sensor data. In the case of a \"push\" action, it increases the probability that the door is open, reflecting the action's effectiveness. It's not entirely certain because there's a 20% chance that pushing will not open the door.\n",
        "\n",
        "Update Step: Upon receiving a new sensor measurement, the filter adjusts its belief. This is where the filter accounts for the sensor's reliability, using probabilities that express the sensor's ability to correctly or incorrectly report the door's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Question 3, the filter processes a sequence of \"push\" actions, each followed by a sensor reading indicating the door is closed. The find_steady_state_belief function iteratively applies these steps until the change in belief between iterations falls below a small threshold, signaling that a steady state has been reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output indicates that after 5 iterations of pushing the door and getting a \"closed\" reading from the sensor, the filter converges to a steady state belief of approximately 76.19%. This means that even though the door is pushed‚Äîwhich has an 80% chance of opening the door‚Äîthe consistent \"closed\" sensor readings prevent the belief from reaching full certainty. The filter has essentially reached a compromise between the expected effect of the action and the contradictory sensor data, reflecting the inherent uncertainties in both.\n",
